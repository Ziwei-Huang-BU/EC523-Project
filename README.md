# EC523-Project
EC523 class project


## Task Description
In this project, we are trying to generate COVID-19 diagnosis results: based on patients’ unlabeled CT scan images, using self-supervised learning (Self-Trans) approach. Considering the less data-rich source on COVID related CT scans, the difficulty of this project will be building a highly efficient deep learning model, pretraining and fine tuning our network in our medical/diagnostic task. Besides reproducing the results as described in the [literature](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063941v1), we will train alternative pretrained models as inputs of Self-Trans algorithm with Momentum Contrast (MOCO) unsupervised learning method, using “Cats vs Dogs” and “Breast Histopathology Images” datasets. For downstream analysis, we will compare the performances of all candidate models and evaluate their specificities in medical applications.
